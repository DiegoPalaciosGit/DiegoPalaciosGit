## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a physics student with a strong interest in theoretical physics, field theory, and quantum theory. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a university research project where my advisors and I am developing a 5-dimensional theory and analyzing its implications in Yang-Mills theory.

Recently, Iâ€™ve started exploring data science to broaden my skill set and pursue a career in this growing field. Iâ€™m eager to merge my analytical background in physics with the practical applications of data science. This repository will serve as a space to showcase my journey, and Iâ€™ll be sharing my portfolio as soon as itâ€™s ready. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
